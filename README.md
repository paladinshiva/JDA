# JDA (Java Discord API)
JDA strives to provide a clean and full wrapping of the Discord REST api and its Websocket-Events for Java.

## JDA 3.x
JDA will be continued with version 3.x and will support Bot-features (for bot-accounts) and Client-features (for user-accounts).
_Please see the [Discord docs](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/reference) for more information about bot accounts._


This officially makes [JDA-Client](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA-Client) deprecated.
Please do not continue using it, and instead switch to the promoted 3.x version listed further below.

## Creating the JDA Object
Creating the JDA Object is done via the JDABuilder class by providing an AccountType (Bot/Client).
After setting the token via setter,
the JDA Object is then created by calling the `.buildBlocking()` or the `.buildAsync()` (non-blocking login) method.

Example:

```java
JDA jda = new JDABuilder(AccountType.BOT).setToken("token").buildBlocking();
```

**Note**: It is important to set the correct AccountType because Bot-accounts require a token prefix to login.

## Events
There are a ***TON*** of events in JDA that you can listen to.<br>
Currently, there are 2 ways of writing your Event-Listener:
  1. Extend ListenerAdapter and use the provided methods that get fired depending on the Event-Type. [Event Methods](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA/blob/master/src/main/java/net/dv8tion/jda/core/hooks/ListenerAdapter.java)
  2. Implement EventListener and listen to onEvent and figure out if it is the event you want (Not suggested)<br>

Listeners can be registered either in the JDABuilder (will catch all Events; recommended), or in the JDA instance (initial Events, especially the *READY*-Event could get lost)

#### Examples:
```java
public class ReadyListener implements EventListener
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
            throws LoginException, RateLimitedException, InterruptedException
    {
        // Note: It is important to register your ReadyListener before building
        JDA jda = new JDABuilder(AccountType.BOT)
            .setToken("token")
            .addEventListener(new ReadyListener())
            .buildBlocking();
    }

    @Override
    public void onEvent(Event event)
    {
        if (event instanceof ReadyEvent)
            System.out.println("API is ready!");
    }
}
```

```java
public class MessageListener extends ListenerAdapter
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
            throws LoginException, RateLimitedException, InterruptedException
    {
        JDA jda = new JDABuilder(AccountType.BOT).setToken("token").buildBlocking();
        jda.addEventListener(new MessageListener());
    }

    @Override
    public void onMessageReceived(MessageReceivedEvent event)
    {
        if (event.isFromType(ChannelType.PRIVATE))
        {
            System.out.printf("[PM] %s: %s\n", event.getAuthor().getName(),
                                    event.getMessage().getContentDisplay());
        }
        else
        {
            System.out.printf("[%s][%s] %s: %s\n", event.getGuild().getName(),
                        event.getTextChannel().getName(), event.getMember().getEffectiveName(),
                        event.getMessage().getContentDisplay());
        }
    }
}
```

> **Note**: In these examples we override methods from the inheriting class `ListenerAdapter`.<br>
> The usage of the `@Override` annotation is recommended to validate methods.

## Contributing to JDA
If you want to contribute to JDA, make sure to base your branch off of our master branch (or a feature-branch)
and create your PR into that **same** branch. **We will be rejecting any PRs between branches!**

It is also highly recommended to get in touch with the Devs before opening Pull Requests (either through an issue or the Discord servers mentioned above).<br>
It is very possible that your change might already be in development or you missed something.
